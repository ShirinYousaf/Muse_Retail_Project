## **Retail Application**

Muse is a online retail company that aims to provide its customers with a smooth and efficient
shopping experience. As the business handles a wide range of products and manages several
customer orders, it needs an organised system to streamline operations. The custom-built
application developed for Muse addresses these needs by combining an Access database,
Excel frontend, and VBA middleware to create a centralised solution for managing customer
information and processing orders efficiently.
The application automates key business functions, such as loading data into excel from
database in access, identifying pending orders, calculating monthly sales, total product sales,
and adding new order details, reducing manual effort and the risk of errors. The Access
database serves as the central repository for all customer, product, and order data, enabling the
business to run various queries to calculate and extract key business insights from the data as
needed. Using Excel as the user interface ensures ease of use for staff, while VBA scripts handle
the complex tasks such as importing data from database, adding new orders through order form
and doing conditional formatting on required data. With this system, Muse can better monitor
its sales performance, improve order fulfillment processes, and ensure a higher level of
customer satisfaction. The application provides a strong foundation to support the growth of the
business, making operations more efficient and adaptable to future needs.
